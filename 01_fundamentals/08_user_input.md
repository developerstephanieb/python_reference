# 08: User Input

This guide outlines how to prompt for and handle user input.

---

## The `input()` Function

The built-in `input()` function is the primary way to get user input. When called, it pauses the program and waits for the user to type text and press Enter.

The entered text is returned as a string, which can be stored in a variable for later use.

```python
# The program will pause here and wait for the user to type their name
print("What is your name?")
name = input()

print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

---

## Providing a Prompt

For a better user experience, display a prompt message that tells the user what to enter. This can be done by passing a string to the `input()` function.


```python
# The string passed to input() is displayed as a prompt
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Welcome, " + name + "!")
```

---

## Type Errors

The `input()` function always returns the user's input as a string, even if they type in numbers.

A **type error** occurs when an operation is performed on a value of the wrong type. When this happens, the interpreter stops and displays a `TypeError`.

### Mixing Strings and Integers (`TypeError`)

```python
# This code will cause an error
age_string = input("How old are you? ")

# You can't add an integer to a string
age_in_ten_years = age_string + 10 
```

Error: `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str`

## Converting Input to the Correct Type

To use the user's input as a number, it must first be converted from a string to the correct data type. This can be done using the built-in `int()` and `float()` functions.

### The `int()` Function

To convert from a string to an integer, use the built-in `int()` function.

Syntax: `int(value, base)`

| Parameter | Required? | Description                                       | Default |
| :-------: | :-------: | ------------------------------------------------- | :-----: |
|   value   |    Yes    | The value to convert to an integer                |    -    |
|   base    |    No     | The numeric base (e.g., 2 for binary, 16 for hex) |   10    |

```python
# Get the user's age as a string
age_string = input("How old are you? ")

# Convert the string to an integer
age_integer = int(age_string)

# Now perform math with it
age_in_ten_years = age_integer + 10
print("In ten years, you will be", age_in_ten_years, "years old.")
```

It is common to combine these steps into a single line:

```python
# Get input and immediately convert it to an integer
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
```

### The `float()` Function

To convert a string to an floating-point number, use the built-in `float()` function.

Syntax: `float(value)`

```python
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))
```
